Scrapy Sentiment Analysis
This guide introduces a beginner-friendly approach to using Scrapy for sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone behind a series of words, typically to understand attitudes, opinions, or emotions expressed within text data.

.. _setting-up-scrapy:

Setting Up Scrapy
Before diving into sentiment analysis with Scrapy, ensure you have Scrapy installed in your Python environment. You can install Scrapy using pip:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install scrapy

Once installed, you're ready to create your Scrapy project for sentiment analysis.

Creating a Scrapy Project
To start a new Scrapy project, navigate to the directory where you want to create the project and run the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    scrapy startproject sentiment_analysis

This command will create a new directory named sentiment_analysis with the basic structure for a Scrapy project.


.. _creating-the-spider:

Creating the Spider
==========================
In Scrapy, spiders are classes that define how a certain site (or a group of sites) will be scraped. You'll need to create a spider to crawl the web and gather data for sentiment analysis. Here's an example of how to create a spider:

.. code-block:: python

    import scrapy

class SentimentSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'sentiment'
    start_urls = ['http://example.com']

    def parse(self, response):
        # Add code to parse the website and extract relevant data
        pass

This is a skeleton of a Scrapy spider. You'll need to customize the parse method to extract the data you want for sentiment analysis.

.. _running-the-spider:

Running the Spider
==========================
Once you've created your spider, you can run it using the Scrapy API. Here's how you can run your spider from a script:

.. code-block:: python

    import scrapy
from scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess

from sentiment_analysis.spiders.sentiment_spider import SentimentSpider

process = CrawlerProcess(settings={
    'FEEDS': {
        'items.json': {'format': 'json'},
    }
})

process.crawl(SentimentSpider)
process.start()

This script will execute your SentimentSpider and store the scraped data in a JSON file named items.json.

.. _analyzing-sentiment:

Analyzing Sentiment
==========================
With the data collected by your spider, you can now perform sentiment analysis using various natural language processing (NLP) libraries like NLTK or spaCy. Analyzing sentiment typically involves tokenizing the text, assigning sentiment scores to words, and aggregating those scores to determine the overall sentiment of the text.

.. note::
Performing sentiment analysis is beyond the scope of Scrapy itself. You'll need to use additional libraries and tools to analyze the scraped data.
